# Hiring the Best Intern

This Python code is designed to help select the best intern from a given dataset of internship applications. It calculates a score for each intern based on predefined criteria and selects the top-scoring intern(s) for consideration.

## Dataset

The dataset should be provided in Excel format, containing the following columns:

- Python (out of 3)
- Machine Learning (out of 3)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) (out of 3)
- Deep Learning (out of 3)
- Other Skills
- Are you available for 3 months, starting immediately, for a full-time work from home internship?
- Degree
- Stream
- Current Year Of Graduation
- Performance_PG
- Performance_UG
- Performance_12
- Performance_10

## Installation

To run the code, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library (`pip install pandas`)

## Usage

1. Place the dataset file `Applications_for_Machine_Learning_internship.xlsx` in the same directory as the Python code file.
2. Open the Python code file `hire_intern.py` in a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
3. Modify the code if needed, such as changing the weights of the criteria or specifying the number of interns to hire.
4. Save the code file.
5. Run the code by executing the command `python hire_intern.py` in the terminal or command prompt.

## Algorithm and Criteria

The algorithm follows the following steps:

1. Read and preprocess the dataset.
2. Define the criteria for selecting the best intern, along with their corresponding weights.
3. Calculate a score for each intern based on the criteria and weights.
4. Rank the interns based on their scores.
5. Select the top-scoring intern(s) for consideration.
6. Provide feedback and notify the selected intern(s).

## Output

The code will output the details of the selected intern(s), including their scores and other relevant information from the dataset.
